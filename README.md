# IMO-EXAM-SCORE PROJECT

### In this project we try to understand whether there is any type of relationship between the numbers the student scores and year as well as hours of study by using different plots. Different plots like bar graphg, line graph, dor plot, pie chart, Donut chart, histogram is used here to make conclusions.


### This project is completely done on basis of a data set that contain different scores of students in IMO examnination over past years. 

### In the begining of the project we have to undertsand the data set provided in the page in comma separated value or popularly knows as '.csv file'. Here are some specifications of the data set--
* The data set contains 15 observations
* Along 12 variables
* The data set contains only numerical values
* There are no string objects in the data set

## **Starting of the project and explanation of each step**

### 1. Importing required packages:
Here first we import different packages sucg as **Matplotlib.pyplot**, **Numpy**, **Pandas**. On top of that we also use the **style module** of matplotlib and the **inline module** to make the plots more attractive.

### 2. Getting the required data:
Here we get the data from the google drive. To attach the Google colab and google drive we import drive from google colab and merge the file named **'IMO_EXAM-SCORE.csv'** as data using read_csv() function of Pandas library.

### 3. Checking the data:
The next step is the most general step involved in analysis of the data set. It is called previewing the data. In this step we can check the whole data set, check number of columns, number of rows etc. 

### 4. Starting of analysis:
In this step we start our analysis by storing the variable names in short variables names to avoid misprint or other mistakes. It is a good practice to save time and spend the saved time in other type of analysis.
